This notebook provides an introduction to using high frequency radar (HFR) data from the Integrated Ocean Observing System network to derive surface current velocity and direction in the Huntington Beach area during the recent oil spill. Here, we utilize 6 km resolution (hourly) HFR data of surface currents and oil blob movements over time with data provided by the Coastal Observing Research and Development Center at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD and the Environmental Response Management Application (ERMA), respectively.
